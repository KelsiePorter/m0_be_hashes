# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I struggled with the formatting for the two hash syntax options. The lesson was written using the hash rocket (=>) but this project used the colon (:) to separate keys and values. It took some research and trial an error to get the spacing correct using the colon hash syntax. I also kept forgetting to separate key-value pairs with a comma. I would try to print to the terminal and the output was not what I was expecting. Luckily, it is an easy fix and the more I worked through the questions, the more I started to remember.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

Note taking is going well for me. I am referencing my notes frequently and I will be glad to have them in the future. This question reminded me that I wanted to number my pages and create a table of contents similar to the example notes. I take the most helpful notes when I am studying on my own ahead of class. I dislike taking extensive notes during a live class because I will inevitably miss something important while I am writing. I have been filling in little notes, tips, etc. during class if an instructor shares something I did not see in the lesson.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I try to solve a problem in code on my own first. I will try this a few times before I head to Google. Since I am still so new at this, I have a hard time filtering out the things I don't need and keying in on the details I do need to find my answer. For example, I will open a Stack Overflow question and answer and the question is not exactly what I am asking so I get a little off track trying to apply my question to answers I am seeing.
